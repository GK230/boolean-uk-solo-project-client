# SwapShop (Frontend)

An online home and fashion swapping and shopping app - users can upload items in return for credits and then spend those credits on other items on the site

As a self confessed shopaholic who does not want to be cured, but also wants to save the planet, I decided to come up with an outlet for my addiction - a new way of shopping. Below is an example of some of the wireframes I used to build the app.

To improve the app, I would definitely try and use Cloudinary for uploading user images, as this method uses less space and is more efficient. Unfortunately, after trying several methods of implementing this, I still had repeated CORS issues.

Next I would like to include a favourites system, or a wishlist, which is available on many ecommerce sites, to make the shopping experience complete.
